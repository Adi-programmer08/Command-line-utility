# Command-line-utility
This is a command line utility to download files in python.

I have used argparse and requests module to run the program.

To run the program simply copy the url of the image you want to download,
Then type in terminal/shell - python (name of py file) (url of the image) -o (name of the file you by which you want to save)

You can also type - python (name of py file) (url of the image)
